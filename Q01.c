//Describe the problem input(s), output(s) and write the algorithm for a program that computes the circle’s area and circumference. Also write a function prototype to compute the same using radius as input to the function and return type void.
/*

Inputs:
Radius of the circle
Outputs:
Area of the circle
Circumference of the circle
Algorithm to Compute Circle's Area and Circumference
Start
Read the radius of the circle
Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: Area = π * r * r
Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula: Circumference = 2 * π * r
Print the area and circumference of the circle
Stop
Function Prototype to Compute Circle's Area and Circumference
void compute(float radius, float *area, float *circumference);
